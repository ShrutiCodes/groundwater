The Ministry of Water Resources(India) needed a tool to monitor and assess groundwater usage of Industries in India. My team developed a real-time monitoring system that includes:
-2D and map visualisation of water usage data
-an AI model to predict future water usage 
-the ability to notify expired/malpractices carried by Industries through email
-configuration options according to administrators needs. 

Officers can now use this tool to monitor the water usage in real time in a centralized, hassle-free manner for Industries throughout India.
